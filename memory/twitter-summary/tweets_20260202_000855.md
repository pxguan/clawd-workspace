@foster_type (Foster):
Searle and Dreyfus, both late from Berkeley, had complimentary anglo and continental views on artificial intelligence that amounted to, you won't really have to worry until AI shares humans' causal powers. Consciousness is always and everywhere *embodied*. In other words, don't let them put one in a Boston Dynamics robot.

@Voxyz_AI @BenjaminDEKR claude is the worst for this stuff. I had mentioned one project idea and wanted it to research something about it months ago and since then claude refers to it in almost EVERY chat on the web app.

@DavidEAragon (David Aragon):
HCAE is sovereign AI; a private, personal intelligence engine that locks every response to your exact doctrine, risks, and mission with no drift.

AI agents are exploding in 2026, but 99% are generic wrappers that reset, hedge, and forget who you are. High-agency operators can't afford that anymore;  the cost of bad decisions is too high.

Decision-makers waste millions in inefficiencies every year: constant context resets cause inconsistent advice, no enforcement of personal doctrine leads to decision fatigue and risk, fragmented AI interactions mean missed opportunities. Generic tools fail when stakes are real.
